spatialization is looking down on the tree?


/

ok. so "load" is how many leaves are supported above. this determines the harmonic ratios. the trunk is 1, and this is integers, so... why am I getting fractions? bug with leaf maturity.

second issue is that it relates to leaves, but the limit is on branches. so branches are going to top out quicker than leaves will get to 16, or whatever.

ok, but at least we understand this.

what scale is all whole number ratios?
it all octaves.

2 2/3 - major sixth
1 1/3 - perfect fourth
1 1/2 - perfect fifth

1 1/7 - a very sharp second
1.6   - ~minor sixth


sounds awesome with lots of 1/3 and 2/3 in there

so there needs to be a formula that isn't dependent on the max tree
which means a leaf speed 1/16 * load
which is the same thing




good intervals:
1, 1/8, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 15/8 (.875)

1: 16
2: 8
3: 5 1/3 - perfect fourth
4: 4
5: 3 1/5
6: 2 2/3 - major sixth
7: 2 2/7
8: 2
9: 1.7777
10: 1.6 - minor sixth
11: 1.454545454545455
12: 1 1/3 - perfect fourth
13: 1.230769230769231
14: 1.142857142857143
15: 1 1/15
16: 1

so this gets tricky, doesn't it?
